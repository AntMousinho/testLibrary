# How to use test functions
To access the built in functions require them within your `spec.js` file:
```
const test = require('mousinho-testlibrary-mse-2103/src/library')
```

Now you can use the built in functions from the packages `library.js` file. These functions have been modelled from the `jasmine` node package.

The functions are:
- `describe()`
- `it()`
- `expect()`
- `assertEquals()`
